<h2>Block Ninja Showdown</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Similar to Cowboy fast draw game, but in Japanese Ninja Style
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game mostly use the  timer feature of phaser 3, which help create a variation of random time delay in either miliseconds or seconds. It also help controling dificulty of the game become  easire. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I have learn a lot throughout this prototype. Because this is the firs time I am coding in javascript, and even the first game I ever make. In my opinion, phaser 3 is actually easy to learn. However, I have some trouble with example, since the example of Phaser2 confused me a lot, and take me really long to figure out it just an outdated format. The hardest part in this prototype is learning how to use the timer feature. 
These are techniques that I have learnt from this assignment:

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The Instant Sword Death (Samurai Kirby) minigame inspired me to make this games. This game is also one of my favorite gmae in Kirby Series.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Since it is based on fast draw game, speed is everything you need to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme I choose is you can't win with sound off.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For this games, it can be an reflexibility training game, or a joker game depends on players
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
It would be reflexibility to the signal. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I would love to see everyone take it as a small minigame that can be both entertained and seft-training. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Since it just a minigame, so I don't think it take a paragraph for a tutorial. Everything you need to do is press the SPACEBAR as fast as possible after you here the signal to help your little block ninja win the battle 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
The strategies could be predicting the range of time when the signal is played, then player can be well prepare than usual.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
	the game doesn't have a backstory, but I use ninja showdown as the main theme of the game, plus the game play is also fast, so it would make the player have better feeling to the awsomeness, but still mystery of the game
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
It would be kid and young teenager. Anyone who is interested in ninja.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
It should take sometime around 10 seconds for each round.
</li>
