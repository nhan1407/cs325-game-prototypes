<h2>Treasure Hunt</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	An Pirate Advanture game
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It use the game setBounce and setVelocity to run the enemies. It recycle the monster everytime it move out of the camera bound. 
* Note: I try to make it chase the character instead. Stil working on it and animation. 

Since my plan for this game is using this game tp iterate in next week, so this is just a demo for background set up (bacground, sfx, character, animation).
The interesting thing is that I had a plan for this game in the future such as player can attack enemies, more platforms will be added, mroe enemies (bird, trap, pirates, etc)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I have learn a lot throughout this prototype. The hardest one for me is setting up a parallax background, which make an infinite background layer. 
I also learn techniques of recycling sprite when they get out of screen.

These are techniques that I have learnt from this assignment:
	<ul>
		<li>Animation:  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.Image.html">Image </a></li>
	</ul>

		<li>Parralax background:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3C5HliTDwM"> Parralax background </a></li>
	</ul>

		<li> Tilemap:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fK6MVLPrMA"> Tilemap  </a></li>
	</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
	It is really simple just like a mario games (or any 2d platform game)
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
	Dodging obstacle and reach the treasure chest
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	Pirates
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For this games, it can be an reflexibility training game, or a joker game depends on players
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
	Advanture + Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
	Enjoy a happy advanture of Captain Clown Nose.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

	This is just a demo for the game, I will try to add more features to the game in the future. Anyway, gameplay for this week is just controling Captain Clown Nose to move foward,
	dodge enemies, and reach the treasure chest.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?

	The strategies here is playing careful, predicting moving enemies instead of trying to speed run.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
	Captain Clown Nose is in an advanture to find the most mystery treasure which was hidding on a dangerous island. There are many dangerous animals (whale, rhino) on the island. Moreover, Captain Clown Nose must also fight against other pirates (will be added in the future)
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	It would be kids and young teenager. Anyone who is interested in pirates.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
It should take sometime around 30 seconds to reach the end of the game.
