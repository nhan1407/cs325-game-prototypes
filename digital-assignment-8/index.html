<h2>Build the Tower</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	A Tower Builder from scratch
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The game use tween to make the swing block on the top </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Make use of both dynamic and static group (I realized that the dynamic objects can't hold more than 2 blocks)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		Special algorithm to check if the block is place correctly or not ()
	</li>
</ul>


<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The game still have some issue that must be fixed. For example if player start droping a blocks before the previous blocks landed, the game will end(crash). 
There also some random distance before each blocks when we drop them. I'm also working on improving the game with scoreboard and unlimited mode 

These are techniques that I have learnt from this assignment:
	<ul>
		<li>Tween:  <a href="https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/tween/"> Tween </a></li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
